# Interfaces

## Research Computing

### OnDemand

[OnDemand](https://openondemand.org/) is an application developed by the Ohio Supercomputing Center
that makes it easy to expose computational resources for remote access. It allows for file and job managemnt,
command-line access, monitoring, and integration of apps like notebooks for various languages.
You can read the [documentation](https://osc.github.io/ood-documentation/latest/) to get started.
To create a dummy environment to test, you can use [ood-compose](https://github.com/vsoch/ood-compose)
alongside [this tutorial for app development](https://osc.github.io/ood-documentation/release-1.6/app-development.html).
If you have any questions or issues, there is a [discourse here](https://discourse.osc.edu/c/open-ondemand/5).

## Science Gateways

A science gateway is another means to allow access to advanced computational resouces, and unlike OnDemand which
is a general tool, they tend to be branded for a specific kind of science. The following science gateways
might be of interest to the RSEng community:
